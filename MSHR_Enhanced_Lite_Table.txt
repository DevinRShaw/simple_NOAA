							EMSHR_LITE.TXT

The Enhanced Master Station History Report (EMSHR) - Lite is a list of basic, historical information for every station in the station history 
database.  While the EMSHR is constructed to be used by programs, the EMSHR Lite is built to be a more user-friendly visual report, and contains
a subset of the most used fields from the full EMSHR.  

Note this file is subject to change as NCEI adds more networks to its station history database and new identifiers.

The file is sorted by ncdcstn_id, begin_date, end_date and its first row contains column headers as described below.

This report is scheduled to be updated monthly.

*** UPDATE, beginning with June 2014 report: New RELOCATION field added to end of each line.

*** UPDATE, beginning with June 2016 report: New GHCNMLT, IGRA, HPD identifier fields added to end of each line.

*** UPDATE, June 2021: Documentation only, updated column descriptions and provided type/platform reference table (B).
